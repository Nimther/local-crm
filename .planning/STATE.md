# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-03)

**Core value:** Маркетолог настраивает триггерную цепочку или кампанию — и письма надёжно и вовремя доходят до нужных контактов, со сквозным отслеживанием статусов (delivered/opened/clicked/bounced).
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Workspace Foundation & Team Access

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Multi-tenancy and send-queue isolation are foundational (Phase 1), not deferred optimizations.
- Broadcast-first send loop: campaigns (Phase 4) prove the send pipeline before flows (Phase 6) reuse it; webhook tracking (Phase 5) closes the loop right after the first real send.
- One shared segment-evaluation engine (Phase 3) serves both campaigns and flows.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Research flags to carry into planning:

- Phase 2/3: benchmark behavioral segment queries at target scale (100k–1M contacts) before committing to the materialized-membership approach.
- Phase 4: load-test triggered-vs-broadcast priority under a large broadcast (target: triggered sends within minutes).
- Phase 5: integration test that replays a real signed SendGrid payload through the full HTTP stack (raw-body verification).
- Phase 6: define quiet-hours timezone source and once-per-N-days re-entry semantics; simulate late-stage flow edits mid-execution.
